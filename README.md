# OpenML ResultExtractor

The OpenML ResultExtractor is a package that allows to analyse the data
at OpenML given different task and flow filters. It builds a Pandas DataFrame
from the Cartesian product of the tasks and flows where each entry can be a run,
a list of runs or empty for the task and flow combination.

For more information on the usage of the ResultExtractor take a look at the notebook
tutorials in the examples folder.
